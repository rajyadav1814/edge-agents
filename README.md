# Agentic Edge Functions

Welcome to the Agentic Edge Functions repository by the Agentics Foundation. This open-source project serves as the technological foundation for distributed autonomous AI agents operating at the edge of networks.

## What are Agentic Edge Functions?

Agentic Edge Functions combine serverless edge computing with autonomous AI capabilities. Running at the network edge, these functions enable AI agents to:

- Operate independently near users for lower latency
- Communicate securely with other agents and systems
- Access controlled resources via defined interfaces
- Scale dynamically based on workload requirements

This infrastructure powers the Agentic Dashboard and Agentic Inbox systems at [agentics.org/dashboard](https://agentics.org/dashboard) and is being actively developed in the open, welcoming community contributions.

## Overview

This repository contains edge functions implementing various patterns for autonomous agent deployment and operation. Built on Supabase's serverless infrastructure and Deno runtime, these functions enable scalable, efficient, and globally distributed agent capabilities. 

Additionally, it includes the `scripts/agentic-mcp/` package, a powerful Model Context Protocol server that enhances AI agents with advanced tools and orchestration capabilities.

## What are Edge Functions?

Edge functions are serverless functions running at network edges, providing low-latency, high-availability compute without server management. Supabase Edge Functions use Deno, a modern secure JavaScript/TypeScript runtime with built-in security features.

### Why Deno?

[Deno](https://deno.land/) is a modern, secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that provides several advantages:

- **Security-first design**: Explicit permissions for file, network, and environment access
- **Built-in TypeScript support**: No configuration needed
- **Modern JavaScript**: Support for ES modules, top-level await, and more
- **Standard library**: Comprehensive, reviewed standard modules
- **Single executable**: No dependency management headaches

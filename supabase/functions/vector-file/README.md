# Vector Agent: AI-Powered Document Intelligence

😎 Vector Agent: Built with OpenAI's new Vector & Web Search, this autonomous agent turns static docs into auto updating knowledge hubs.

I built this in under an hour on todays Ai Hacker League live Coding session. Crazy. 

Imagine uploading thousands of PDFs, docs, and markdown files, then asking complex questions and getting precise, ranked responses, not just from your stored documents but fused with real-time web data for a complete answer.

## How It Works

At its core, this is a vector search agent that transforms unstructured files into a dynamic knowledge base. Instead of dumping files into a blob of data, you create vector stores, self-contained repositories with expiration rules to keep information relevant. 

You then upload text, PDFs, code (entire repositories), or documents, and the system chunks them into searchable contextual segments, enabling deep, context-aware retrieval rather than just surface-level keyword matching. 

Think not just saving your documents or code, but enabling real time & continuous updates to contextually related information. This could include related news, code vulnerabilities, case law, competitors, basically things that change over time.

The hybrid search blends vector-based embeddings with keyword ranking, giving you the best of both worlds, semantic understanding with precision tuning. The agent automatically handles this. 

The Web search integration pulls in real-time updates, ensuring responses stay accurate and relevant, eliminating AI hallucinations.

You can chat with your data. 

Ask questions, get responses grounded in your documents, and refine results dynamically, turning traditional search into something that feels as natural as messaging a deep research assistant. 

Plus, real-time indexing ensures that newly added files become immediately searchable within seconds.

### Real World Example: Law Firm Knowledge Management Agent

A legal team needs to find key precedents for intellectual property disputes. Instead of manually searching through case files, they ask: "What are the most relevant rulings in the last five years?" 

The system:
1. Searches stored case law in their vector database.
2. Cross-checks recent court decisions using OpenAI's web search capability.
3. Returns a ranked, high-confidence answer, ensuring compliance with legal and ethical/legal guardrails.

```json
{
  "chunkingStrategy": {
    "max_chunk_size_tokens": 1000,  // Between 100-4096
    "chunk_overlap_tokens": 200     // Non-negative, <= max_chunk_size_tokens/2
  }
}
```

### Ranking Options

    "score_threshold": 0.8          // 0.0 to 1.0
  }
}
```

### Metadata Filtering

Filter search results based on file metadata:

```json
{
  "filters": {
    "type": "eq",          // Exact match
    "key": "type",         // Metadata field
    "value": "blog"        // Target value
  }
}
```

### Expiration Policies

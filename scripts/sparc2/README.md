# SPARC Code Agent + MCP Server
SPARC 2.0: agentic code analysis and generation. It's an intelligent coding agent framework built to automate and streamline software development. It combines secure execution environments, vector similarity (Code and Unified Diffs), version control, secure sandbox/code interpreter, OpenAi agents API and Model Context Protocol (MCP) capabilities into a unified system where specialized agents collaborate to understand, modify, and manage code. 

These agents analyze patterns, suggest improvements, implement changes, and validate solutions, all while maintaining a detailed history that allows for easy rollbacks when needed.
### Install globally
``` npm install -g @agentics.org/sparc2 ```

# SPARC 2.0 (alpha)

By bridging the gap between human developers and AI assistants, SPARC 2.0 enhances productivity across the entire development lifecycle, from initial code review to final deployment.

A defining feature of SPARC is its ability to track code changes over time, functioning like a perfect memory of your code's evolution. It uses a unified diff system to capture precisely what changed between versions rather than storing entire files, dramatically reducing storage needs and speeding up operations. By default, the system tracks changes at the file level for optimal performance, yet it can zoom in to function-level tracking when more granular detail is required. This efficient diff tracking ensures smooth performance whether you are working on a small project or a massive enterprise codebase.

Essentially, SPARC acts as an advanced version control enhancer that integrates with Git and GitHub while leveraging artificial intelligence to manage updates automatically. Its understanding of temporal relationships between code modifications allows it to orchestrate complex workflows that support simultaneous contributions from both human developers and AI agents. SPARC adapts its processing pace to match developers' speed, ensuring seamless, conflict-free collaboration.

At the heart of SPARC lies its vector store, a specialized database that transforms code and text into abstract patterns. Instead of merely memorizing exact words, it captures the underlying meaning of the code, similar to understanding cooking techniques rather than just listing ingredients. This approach enables the system to locate similar code snippets despite differences in variable names or styles, creating a smart library of your development history.

Another key element is its integrated code interpreter built using E2B—a language-agnostic execution environment that builds, runs, and modifies code without relying on a traditional IDE. It creates secure, isolated sandboxes for execution across languages such as Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, and more. 

SPARC 2.0 employs a ReACT (Reason + Act) strategy to semantically understand code. It first reasons about what the code means and then takes appropriate actions. This combination of efficient diff tracking and intelligent reasoning enables rapid processing of large codebases without sacrificing deep comprehension of the code's purpose and structure.

- `--mode`: Execution mode (automatic, semi, manual, custom, interactive)
- `--diff-mode`: Diff mode (file, function)
- `--processing`: Processing mode (sequential, parallel, concurrent, swarm)
- `--config, -c`: Path to the agent configuration file

This is useful for integrations that communicate with SPARC2 over HTTP.

#### 2. MCP Stdio Server

The `mcp` command starts a server that implements the MCP protocol over standard input/output (stdio):

```bash
# Using the sparc command
./sparc mcp

# Or with npm installation
sparc2 mcp
```

Options:
- `--model`: Model to use for the agent
- `--mode`: Execution mode (automatic, semi, manual, custom, interactive)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sparc2-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/sparc2/src/mcp/mcpServerWrapper.js"
      ],
      "workingDirectory": "/path/to/sparc2",
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": [
        "analyze_code",
        "modify_code",
        "search_code",
        "create_checkpoint",
        "rollback",
        "config"
      ],
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your-openai-api-key",
        "OPENROUTER_API_KEY": "your-openrouter-api-key",
        "E2B_API_KEY": "your-e2b-api-key",
        "MCP_SECRET_KEY": "your-mcp-secret-key",
        "SPARC2_CONFIG_PATH": "/path/to/sparc2/config.toml",
        "SPARC2_AGENT_CONFIG_PATH": "/path/to/sparc2/agent-config.toml",
        "OPENAI_MODEL": "gpt-4o"
      },
      "timeout": 300
